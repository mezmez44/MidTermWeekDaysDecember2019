Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
Answer:

A Programming language is a computer language programmers use to develop applications. It is  a set of commands, instructions, and other syntax
 use to create a software program. Languages that programmers use to write code are called "high-level languages." ... Languages

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Answer:

The JDK is a software package that contains a variety of tools and utilities that make it possible to develop, package, monitor and deploy
 applications that build for any standard Java platform.

1- Javac: Is a Java Compiler tool located in bin folder of the JDK installation directory is accessed by using the command javac .

2-Java Interpreter: Java interpreter is used to interpret the .class Java files that have been compiled by Java compiler (javac). Java interpreter is accessed using java command. The java command starts a Java
 application. It does this by starting a Java runtime environment, loading a specified class, and calling that class's main method.

3-Java Disassembler: The javap command is the disassembly tool of JDK that disassembles one or more class files. Its output depends on the
options used.  If no options are used, javap prints out the package, protected, and public fields and methods of the classes passed to it.
The javap prints its output to stdout.

4-Java Applet Viewer: This is used to view the Java applets. The appletviewer command connects to the documents or resources designated by urls
 and displays each applet referenced by the documents in its  own window.

5-Java Debugger: The Java Debugger, jdb, is a simple command-line debugger for Java classes. It is a demonstration of the Java Platform Debugger
 Architecture that provides inspection and debugging of a local or remote Java Virtual Machine.

6-Java Documentation: Java Documentation helps to maintain code. The javadoc tool comes as part of Java Development Kit that parses the declarations and
 documentation comments in a set of Java source files and produces a corresponding set of HTML pages describing (by default) the public and protected classes, nested classes
(but not anonymous inner classes), interfaces, constructors, methods, and fields.

7-Java Header File Generator: Java Header File Generator (javah command-line tool) generates C header and source files that are needed to
implement native methods.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Answer:

There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:

1-Editing the program:
First, we need to type the program in text-editor (ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc).
After completing the typing , we have to save the file. While saving the file we  should remember that the file must be
saved with .java extension. It is a good convention to save the file with the name of the class.

2-Compiling the source code:
Second step is the compilation of the source code. The name of the Java compiler is javac. The input to the compiler is
Java source code which is available in .java Extension.  The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform
independent code which is known as bytecode. The file which is generated after compilation is .class file.

3-Executing the byte code
Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM). THE Input
 to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.

what is class?
Answer:

A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe
the behavior of an object

What is object?
Answer:

An object is an instance of a class. An object has state and behavior.

What is the entry point of an application?
Answer:

Java main method is the entry point of any java program.

Why main is static?
Answer:
Java program's main method has to be declared static because keyword static allows main to be called without creating an object of the class
in which the main method is defined. In this case, main method  must be declared as public , since it must be called by code outside of its
class when the program is started

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
Answer:

class Object :java.lang.Object is the superclass for all the java classes and we don’t need to extend it.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?
Answer:

PATH is an environment variable used by the operating system to locate the executables. That’s why when we install Java or want any executable
to be found by OS, we need to add the directory location in the PATH variable.

Classpath is specific to java and used by java executables to locate class files. We can provide the classpath location while running java
 application and it can be a directory, ZIP files, JAR files etc.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Answer:

abstract keyword is used to create abstract class whereas interface is the keyword for interfaces.
Abstract classes can have method implementations whereas interfaces can’t.
A class can extend only one abstract class but it can implement multiple interfaces.
We can run an abstract class if it has main() method whereas we can’t run an interface.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Answer:

No we can not create an object from an Interface or from an Abstract class. if we need to create an object  we need
to implement all the interface methods  and all the abstract methods from the abstract class in a concrete class.

what is Access Specifier?
Answer:

Access modifiers are special keywords which are used to restrict the access of a class, constructor, data member and method
in another class. Java supports four types of access modifiers:
1-Default
2-Private
3-Protected
4-Public

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
answer:
Oriented Object Programming :
1-Inheritance:
Inheritance in Java is the concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps to reuse
the code and establish a relationship between different classes. Inheritance is performed between two types of classes:

Parent class (Super or Base class)
Child class (Subclass or Derived class)
A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known
 as Parent class.

2-Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data(variables) and code(methods) together as a single unit.The data is
 hidden from the outer world and can be accessed only via current class methods.  This helps in protecting the data from
 any unnecessary modification. We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:

1-Declaring the variables of a class as private.
2-Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the values of the variables.


3-Polymorphism:
Answer:

Polymorphism is a OOPs concept where one name can have many forms. (will example add)
	For example, you have a smartphone for communication. The communication mode you choose could be anything. It can be
	a call, a text message, a picture message, mail, etc. So, the goal is common that is communication, but their approach
	is different. This is called Polymorphism. two types overriding and overloading.

4-Abstraction:
Abstraction refers to the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events. It basically deals with hiding the details
and showing the essential things to the user. Thus you can say that abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the
implementation details from the user and revealing only the functionality to them.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
Answer:

package is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
by default: java.lang is the package that  is imported implicitly.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Answer:
Java application programming interface (API) is a list of all classes that are part of the Java development kit (JDK).
It includes all Java packages, classes, and interfaces, along with their methods, fields, and constructors.
These pre-written classes provide a tremendous amount of functionality to a programmer.
i have used java.* package.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Answer:

java does not support multiple inheritances through classes because it leads to overriding of methods when both extended
 class have a same method name. so one class can not extend 2 classes at the same time,
 but through the interfaces we can have multiple inheritance because one class can implements 2 interfaces .

we can use multiple inheritances:
Answer:

Through interfaces, we can implement multiple inheritance in java. A class in java can not extend more than one
class, but a class can implement more than one interface.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Answer:
 A Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have a different number of
parameters or parameters having different types and order. All the methods must have a different signature.

It happens at compile-time.



Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Answer:
Exception is an abnormal condition which occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts normal flow of the program.
This exception must be handled properly. If it is not handled, program will be terminated abruptly.
Exceptions in java are handled using try, catch and finally blocks.

try block : The code or set of statements which are to be monitored for exception are kept in this block.

catch block : This block catches the exceptions occurred in the try block.

finally block : This block is always executed whether exception is occurred in the try block or not and occurred
exception is caught in the catch block or not.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
answer:

In Java, a static member is a member of a class that isn't associated with an instance of a class. Instead, the member
belongs to the class itself. As a result, you can access the static member without first creating a class instance.

static keyword can be used with class level variables to make it global i.e all the objects will share the same variable.
static keyword can be used with methods also. A static method can access only static variables of class and invoke only
static methods of the class.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Answer:

final is a  keyword used with Class to make sure no other class can extend it.
We can use the final keyword with methods to make sure child classes can’t override it.
final keyword can be used with variables to make sure that it can be assigned only once. However the state of the variable can be changed, for example, we can assign a final variable to an object only once but the object variables can change later on.
ava interface variables are by default final and static.

What is final, finally and finalize?
Answer:

Final is a keyword used to apply restrictions on class, method and variable. Final class can't be inherited,
final method can't be overridden and final variable value can't be changed.

Finally is a block is used to place important code, it will be executed whether exception is handled or not.

Finalize is a method  is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.


What is a constructor ?
Answer:

constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the
class. Also, it has no return type and it is automatically called when an object is created.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Answer:
yes we can have multiple constructor.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Answer:

A default constructor witch is created by Java  compiler.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Answer:

Keyword "this " is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object.
What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
Answer:

The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.
super it can be used to refer to variable or constructor.

What is JVM stand for ?
Answer:

JVM Stands for Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
Answer:
The JVM is not platform independent.

What version of java are you using?
Answer:
java version "1.8.0_221.

What is JAR stand for ?
Answer:

JAR stands for Java ARchive.
JAR stands for "Java Archive". A JAR file is basically a zip-file which contains a couple of class files and a text file.

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
Answer:

JDK contains JVM and whole other tools for java development inside it.
- JVM converts bytecode to machine code and execute it on machine.
- There is no matching functionality between JDK and JVM.


What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
Answer:

is an abstract machine. It is a specification that provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.
JRE is used to provide runtime environment.It is the implementation of JVM.It physically exists.

What is compile time and run time?
Answer:

Compile-time is the instance where the code you entered is converted to executable.
Run-time is the instance where the executable is running.

What is heap?
Answer:

Runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays are located.

How java manage it's memory?
Answer:

The JVM loads the code, verifies the code, executes the code, manages memory
(this includes allocating memory from the Operating System (OS), managing Java allocation
including heap compaction and removal of garbage objects) and finally provides the runtime environment.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
Answer:

 String is immutable, if you try to alter their values, another object gets created.
StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable so they can change their values.
The difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder is that StringBuffer is thread-safe.

What is Singleton class?
Answer:

- Singleton class is to control object creation by keeping private constructor so we can ony instantiate one object .

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Answer:

Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of bytes
which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent through streams.
The reverse process of creating object from sequence of bytes is called deserialization.
when to use transient variable in java?
Answer:

transient is a variables modifier used in serialization. At the time of serialization,
if we don’t want to save value of a particular variable in a file, then we use transient keyword.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
Answer :

While loop executes the code block only if the condition is True.
Do While loop, condition is tested at the end of the loop so Do While executes
the statements in the code block at least once even if the condition Fails.


What is Enum?
Answer:

Enum was introduced in Java 1.5 as a new type whose fields consists of fixed set of constants. For example,
in Java we can create Direction as enum with fixed fields as EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOUTH.
enum is the keyword to create an enum type and similar to the class. Enum constants are implicitly static and final.

What is Iterator?
Answer:



Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
Answer:

int is a primitive data type which takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store.
Integer is an object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store int value so each Integer
 object can occupy 4 (or more) times the storage space as a primitive 'int'.

Why is String Immutable in Java?

What is constructor chaining in Java?
The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
What is JIT stands for?
Answer:

Just In Time compilation
Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Answer:

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
Answer:

no
What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Answer:

The main difference between heap and stack is that stack memory is used to store local variables and function callwhile heap memory is used to store objects in Java.
If there is no memory left in the stack for storing function call or local variable,
JVM will throw java.lang.StackOverFlowError, while if there is no more heap space for creating an object,
JVM will throw java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space.
stack memory is a lot lesser than the size of  heap memory in Java.
Variables stored in stacks are only visible to the owner Thread while objects created in the heap are visible to all thread

Major difference between Heap and Stack memory are as follows:
Answer:

Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.
Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space and stack memory contains the reference to it.
Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables to objects in heap space.
Memory management in the stack is done in a LIFO manner whereas it’s more complex in Heap memory because it’s used
globally.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
answer:
Reflection in Java is the ability to examine and/or modify the properties or behavior of an object at run-time.

what is multithreading in java?
Answer:

Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution
of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilization of CPU

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
answer:

Synchronization is the process of allowing threads to execute one after another.

What is Framework?
Answer:
Frameworks are large bodies (usually many classes) of pre_written code to which
 you add your own code to solve a problem in a specific domain.


What are the testing Framework available in java?
Answer:

1-testNG.
2-JUnit.


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
Answer:

TestNG is quite similar to JUnit, but with added functionality and features such as parallel test execution,
parameterization, and more. It is inspired by JUnit and NUnit.

What are the dependencies for this project?

what is dependency injection in java?
answer:

In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique whereby one object
(or static method) supplies the dependencies of another object.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?
Answer:

static binding in Java occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
private , final and static methods and variables use static binding and are bonded by compiler
while virtual methods are bonded during runtime based upon runtime object.
